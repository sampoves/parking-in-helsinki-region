# parking-in-helsinki-region
Current project:

Leaflet.js Parking survey consists of
* index.html - main HTML stuff and a lot of JavaScript
* park_survey.js - L.Popup requires HTML code as a variable. This file contains the Popup parking survey in HTML as a variable
* style.css - style sheet

Old stuff:
