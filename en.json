    "lang_welcome2": "The aim of this survey is to find out how long is the process of parking a private car in Helsinki Capital Region. All aspects of the process are taken into account: how long was the parking spot searched for, where was the parking location and where was the actual final destination of that journey. The results of this survey are used in University of Helsinki Master's thesis in the field of geoinformatics. You can learn more about the thesis below in the paragraph 'Detailed information about survey'.",
    "lang_welcome3": "This survey aims for easy answering: If you can’t recall exact time or locations for your parking, you may insert estimations about them. You may answer to this survey after each private car journey you have in Helsinki Capital Region, or fill out the survey multiple times in one sitting, whatever suits you best.",
    "lang_welcome4": "If possible, please consider responding to this survey multiple times. The survey is open until 31th March 2019.",
    "lang_welcome5": "<b>NB!</b> Please note that <i>this survey does not study parking to respondent's home yard or to a place where respondent has a personal parking spot</i>.",

    "lang_about1": "The aim of this survey is to find out characteristics about private car parking in Helsinki Capital Region with the central question being 'what are the spatial differences between regions of Helsinki Capital Region in parking times?'. The survey complies with 'door-to-door' approach – meant to measure travel times and distances – introduced in Salonen & Toivonen (2013), where the parking process is a part of the whole. As per the approach this survey asks the respondent <b>1)</b> how long did it take to park the car after starting to look for a parking spot, <b>2)</b> where was the parking spot located and <b>3)</b> where was the final destination of that journey located. The results of this survey form the foundation for my University of Helsinki Department of Geosciences and Geography master's thesis, currently titled 'Parking of private cars and spatial accessibility in Greater Helsinki Area'. The results of my master's thesis will be used to improve the accuracy of the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix (Toivonen et al. 2015) developed by Accessibility Research Group, a group of researchers within Helsinki University Digital Geography Lab. Currently the group has access to only rough estimates of parking times in Helsinki Capital Region (Kalenoja & Häyrynen 2003). The hypothesis of my thesis is that the time it takes to complete the parking process varies spatially and temporally in the area. I invite you to familiarise yourself with the research of <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/digital-geography-lab'>Digital Geography Lab</a> (opens in a new tab).",
    "lang_about2": "<b>About privacy:</b> In this survey you are queried locations of your parkings and final destinations of your journey. This is potentially sensitive personal information. Personal details can't be derived from your answers and your multiple answers can’t be detected to belong to the same person. The spatial data gathered in this survey and used in my master's thesis will be placed upon a 250 meters x 250 meters grid (Finnish Environmental Institute 2016) which removes exact location of your parking and destination. The study has no interest in scales more detailed than this. You may view the study area and the exact shape of the cell grid <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='http://www.helsinki.fi/science/accessibility/tools/YKR/YKR_Identifier.html'>here</a> (opens in a new tab).",
