    "lang_welcome2": "The aim of this survey is to find out how long is the process of parking a private car in Helsinki Capital Region. All aspects of the process are taken into account: how long was the parking spot searched for and how long it took to reach one's final destination by foot. The results of this survey will be used in University of Helsinki Master's thesis in the field of geoinformatics. You can learn more about the thesis and this survey research in the tab 'About the research'.",
    "lang_welcome3": "In this survey you are asked to pinpoint postal code areas in Helsinki Capital Region where you have parked during the last two years. For each postal code area you are then asked to answer to five questions concerning your parking in that area. The scope is general, you will not be answering about specific parking, but how your parking experience <i>usually</i> is. In this web application you may add as many postal code areas you wish and be done with the survey in one session, or send smaller batches. Please only answer once for any postal code area.",

    "lang_about3": "This survey research is a part of the Master’s thesis of Sampo Vesanen. The work is connected to the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix, a tool created by Digital Geography Lab which represents travel time distances between statistical grid cells in Helsinki Region by public transport, walking and bicycling. The values in the travel time matrix are calculated using the door-to-door approach. For private cars this means that searching for parking, the parking proper and walking to one’s destination is a part of the travel time. Up until now the time it takes to carry out this process has been a singular estimation deployed to the entire Helsinki Capital Region. This does not represent reality well enough.",
